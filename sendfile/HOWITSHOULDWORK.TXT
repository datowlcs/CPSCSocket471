HOW THE PROGRAM SHOULD WORK:

./server connects
./client connects

on client connect, a loop needs to exist that only exits on CTRL+C instructional (sigint)

when we enter this function, the client should print FTP> then allow us to input (get/ls/file) commands

this will be our first link (client -> server) and this is where all error handling is dealt with

when a command is run, we then enter that function and create a new ephemeral port connection - this is our data link

all data is sent through this link but all information is sent to the main link
